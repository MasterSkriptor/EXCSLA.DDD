# EXCSLA.DDD
Domain Driven Design Core and Framework for EXCSLA designed websites. Created to deploy to nuget and can be used for modern ddd designed websites and apis.

# Core
The Core project will contain any shared entities, aggregates, and events that are needed on most or all websites / apis created by EXCSLA.

# Framework
The framework project will contain any boiler plate code needed for framework services and data access used by EXCSLA. This section may entail multiple projects and seperate Nuget packages so that services not needed by any particular site do not have to reference them.
